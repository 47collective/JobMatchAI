```

### Example

```bash
python JobApplyAI.py "https://careers-company.icims.com/jobs/1234/software-engineer/job"
```

## Configuration

### Resume File
Create a text file containing your resume information. The script will automatically extract:
- Your name and email
- Experience highlights
- Technical skills

### Cover Letter Instructions
Create a text file with your cover letter preferences including:
- Quick hits/achievements to highlight
- Preferred tone and style
- Specific experiences to emphasize

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `RESUME_PATH` | Path to your resume file | `/path/to/resume.txt` |
| `COVER_LETTER_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH` | Path to cover letter instructions | `/path/to/instructions.txt` |
| `BROWSER_HEADLESS` | Run browser in headless mode | `true` or `false` |
| `BROWSER_TIMEOUT` | Page load timeout in milliseconds | `30000` |
| `DEFAULT_JOB_URL` | Default job URL for testing | `https://example.com/job` |

## Output

For each job application, the script creates a folder named `CompanyName_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` containing:

- `YourName_CompanyName_CoverLetter.txt` - Personalized cover letter
- `CompanyName_JobDescription.txt` - Extracted job description

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Resume file not found"**: Check the `RESUME_PATH` in your `.env` file
2. **"Cover letter instructions not found"**: Verify `COVER_LETTER_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH` is correct
3. **Job description shows "None"**: Some sites require manual job description copying due to chat overlays or dynamic content

### Browser Issues

If you encounter browser-related errors:
```bash
playwright install chromium  # Reinstall browser
```
